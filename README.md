**Circus** — *Circus is a Ringmaster, keeping Credentials and User Stuff*

OK, the acronym is a bit contrived. Sorry.

No, I will not remove the red nose.

# What is it?

Circus is –well, will be– a password manager.

It is meant as the successor of the venerable
[pwd](https://github.com/cadrian/pwd/) but using standard technologies
(C and mainstream libraries).
